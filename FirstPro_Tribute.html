	<p><em><b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</b></em> was our extremely beloved President. He was a person genuinely loved and admired across India. Dr. Kalam is fondly remembered as a scientist and a teacher and for his contributions towards education.</p>

<p>Dr. Kalam ignited several young minds to think, innovate and serve.Dr. Kalam wished to be remembered as a teacher and was well-aware of the importance of nurturing future generations.</p>
<p style="color:orange";>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the <abbr title="Madras Institute of Technology" style="color: green">MIT</abbr> and in 1958 joined the <abbr title="Defence Research and Development Organisation" style="color: green">DRDO.</abbr> In 1969 he moved to the <abbr title="Indian Space Research Organisation" style="color: green">ISRO</abbr>, where he was project director of the <em><b>SLV-III</b></em>, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <em><b><quote>Missile Man</quote></b></em> Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>

<b><p style="text-align:center;color:blue;">
Kalam was the scientific adviser to the defense minister of India</p></b>

<p style="color:green";>His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.
In <em><b style="color:red";>1998</b></em>Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called <em><b><u>Technology Vision 2020</u></b></em>, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. 

The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.

In <em><b style="color:red";>2002</b></em> India’s ruling <abbr title="National Democratic Alliance">NDA</abbr>put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy.

Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in <em><b style="color:red";>July 2002.</b></em> He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.</p>
